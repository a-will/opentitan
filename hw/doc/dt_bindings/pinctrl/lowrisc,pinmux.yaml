  OpenTitan's pinmux binding

  OpenTitan's pinmux has independent pad output muxes and peripheral input
  muxes.

  Device mux configurations should be placed in child nodes of the pinmux device
  node. Inside the child node, the 'padmux' and 'periphmux' properties define
  selections for pad output muxes and peripheral input muxes, respectively. For
  both properties, a single 32-bit unsigned integer represents the combination
  of 'mux_id' and 'select_id' to configure the mux. The encoding places the
  'mux_id' in the upper 16 bits and the 'select_id' in the lower 16 bits. For
  peripheral input muxes, 'select_id' chooses the pad or constant to drive the
  peripheral input. For pad output muxes, 'select_id' selects the peripheral or
  constants to drive the pad driver's output and output-enable signals.
